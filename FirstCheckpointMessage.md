Hello again Mark,

So I now have access to the roadmap, checkpoints etc... finally! ***(Yay!)***

So as per the first checkpoint suggestion, here is a little Tricia-Fun-Fact:  
* I adore all animals - with the distinct exception of bees, mosquitos, roaches and *spiders* - there's  a standing kill-on-sight rule within a 10 foot radius of me. (**MOSTLY** a joke.)
* I have had everything from iguanas, beardies, and snakes to my current pets residing in my household including:
  * Boyfriend's 3 cats:
    * Paranoid
    * Panic
    * Pollo
  * My beautifully fluffy spastic cat I caught outside his old apartment named Luna after my favorite anime cat growing up in Sailor Moon.
  * Eva - my fluffy dancing bear - adopted from a coworker's friend who decided having a dog would be too much trouble and were going to give her to be a breeder.  People can be cruel.
  * Nicky - adopted from a coworker who had an accidental litter.  He has to wear baby clothes because he is the runt & has a chronic skin condition causing him to loose his body hair. *Eek!!!*
  * Lily - my first Yorkie named for my grandmother's favorite flower.
  * Lucky - my solution to my mother's loneliness when I went to college.  I took her to get a dog, they had one left because no one wanted him.  She fell in love on sight.  He still hangs his head over edges like he used to hang his head out of his cage in the pet store.
* Ok yes more about my animals. , but I needed some ramblings to use different elements of markdown as per the assignment :)

* So, I am in  Bloc to learn to code, give myself a more comprehensive base than other bootcamps, to start and give direction a new career and to provide a direction and foundation for continuing studies.

Well, enough is enough with all of this.  I'll see you tomorrow!

~Tricia

PS - How do I meet, is it through ScreenHero, Hangouts, Bloc website, or  which?  Anyhow see you soon!
